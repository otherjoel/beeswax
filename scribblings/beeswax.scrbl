@defmodule[beeswax]

Beeswax is a simple templating language. A Beeswax template wraps its contents in a function
that can be imported by other modules and applied to data to get a rendered document.
Having a @hash-lang[] for your templates has two minor benefits: it lights up all the little
conveniences of your IDE if you use one (DrRacket, racket-mode, etc.) and it can make
renders faster (because the template can be compiled).

Beeswax was designed to be easy to use within
@seclink["top" #:doc '(lib "pollen/scribblings/pollen.scrbl")]{Pollen} projects, but can
be of use in other Racket projects as well.

@bold{Warning:} Beeswax isnâ€™t done yet, and will probably change.
