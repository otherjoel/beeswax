beeswax [![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.0-4baaaa.svg)](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
=======

Beeswax is a `#lang` (a [Racket][r] DSL) for string-based templates, as well as some facilities for
applying templates to sources. It is designed to fit seamlessly into [Pollen][pp] projects but could
be useful in other contexts.
