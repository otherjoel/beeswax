=======

Beeswax is a `#lang` (a [Racket][r] DSL) for string-based templates, as well as some facilities for
applying templates to sources. It is designed to fit seamlessly into [Pollen][pp] projects but could
be useful in other contexts.

**Documentation is at <https://docs.racket-lang.org/beeswax/index.html>**

To install Beeswax from the command line:

    > raco pkg install beeswax

Or using DrRacket: click the **File** menu → **Install Package …** and enter `beeswax`.
